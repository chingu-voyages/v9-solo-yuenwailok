<h3>The Modern Delivery Platform</h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-md-6"><h6>Automated Delivery for All of Your Projects</h6><p>Evolve delivery flow in one place, not repository by repository. Get consistent, automated delivery across all projects with an event-driven Software Delivery Machine.
</p></div>
<div class="col-12 col-md-6"><h6>Visualize and Control the Entire Delivery Flow</h6><p>Know the delivery state of all your projects, all the time. See all activity across your delivery flow, from initial commit through to promotion and verification in production. Take direct action when needed in chat or by issuing commands.
</p></div>
<div class="col-md-6"><h6>Self-Service</h6><p>Make actions accessible with notifications and commands. Remove the friction of having to request resources, or the toil of setting up the delivery process yourself. Put the entire delivery process in front of you, so that you always have visibility and control.
</p></div>
<div class="col-md-6"><h6>Deployment Built-In</h6><p>Deploy to your platform of choice in the cloud or self-hosted. Easy one-time setup to deploy to Kubernetes (whether you use Minikube, Google Kubernetes Engine, Azure Kubernetes Service, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, RedHat OpenShift, Pivotal Container Service or open source Kubernetes), Cloud Foundry, ECS, Fargate and more.
</p></div>
<div class="col-md-6"><h6>Collaboration-Oriented Delivery</h6><p>Chat-native interface makes your delivery process part of the conversation in Slack or Microsoft Teams. See delivery progress in chat and take action immediately: Merge a pull request, assign an issue, or approve a deployment. Atomist bot commands make it easy to create projects or initiate a deployment.
</p></div>
<div class="col-md-6"><h6>Fully Programmable Delivery That Evolves with You</h6><p>Change your delivery by changing code. Whether youâ€™re adding vulnerability scanning, pushing Docker images to a different artifact store, or adding your own bot commands your delivery process is completely programmable. We think code speaks louder than YAML.

<h1>The Software Delivery Machine</h1>
<p>At the heart of Atomist is the Software Delivery Machine (SDM).</p>
<p>Itâ€™s an event-driven delivery automation engine that maintains a rich model of your app and delivery flow and is fully programmable in code.</p>
<ul>
<li><div><h3>Command Interface</h3><p>The Atomist command interface gives you direct control to take actions like creating a new project or approving a deployment. Atomist has a rich command framework for you to create custom commands that are available to everyone in chat or via command-line. Commands can be attached to chat notifications so that users can take action right there.
</p></div></li>
<li><div><h3>ChatOps</h3><p>Put complete visibility into the delivery flow in front of everyone in your team with correlated and actionable notifications directly in chat. Notifications keep everyone up to speed. Native chatops with bot support in Slack and Microsoft Teams means better team alignment and collaboration.
</p></div></li>
<li><div><h3>Event Hub
</h3><p>Atomist is an event-driven delivery platform that captures events from all stages of development delivery, correlates events to track the flow of activity, triggers automation action from any event, and logs activity for a full audit trail.
</p></div></li>
<li><div><h3>Cortex
</h3><p>Cortex is Atomistâ€™s queryable graph database of correlated events and information related to your projects. Use it for reporting, commands and notifications.
</p></div></li>
<li><div><h3>Integrations</h3><p>Bi-directional integration with third-party tools used in your development and delivery flow means Atomist receives events, and also integrates with those tools APIs to directly execute delivery stages.
</p></div></li>
</ul>
